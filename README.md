# Yelp Ratings Visualization

*Dataset*: Review data from 100 restaurants in Las Vegas 

*Goal*: Show the temporal evolution of the restaurants. The design considers these questions: 
- Are there restaurants that have consistently positive/negative reviews?
- Are there restaurants that for which in some time periods their rating drops/increases considerably?
- How many restaurants are in each category?
- How are the ratings distributed in each category over time? Are there categories  in which restaurants tend to have more positive/negative ratings?
